        <p>Dear Shagun,</p>
        <p>
          Happy Birthday to the girl who is beautiful, cute, dramatic, and
          secretly very soft-hearted. Thank you for being part of my Class 10
          story and for making this last year so special.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with your trust issues and panda mood swings, you are one of
          the most genuine people I know. No filter, no fake – just real.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t know where we’ll be after this year, but I hope you always
          remember that there is at least one person in this world who will
          always root for you.
